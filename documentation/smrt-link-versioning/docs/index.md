# SMRT Link Versioning

[SMRT Link](https://www.pacb.com/smrt-link/) is a set of Pacbio Software tools for Sequel II/IIe and Revio systems designed to set up and monitor long-read HiFi sequencing runs, review performance metrics, analyze, visualize, and annotate sequencing data.

SMRT Link Versioning is an architecture in Traction (libraries and configuration) to create sample sheets that allows us to support multiple versions of SMRT Link using configuration and limited code changes.
