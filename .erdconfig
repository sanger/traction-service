# The file type of the generated diagram. PDF output is strongly recommended, other formats may render
# significantly worse. The available formats depend on your installation of Graphviz. If you set the
#file type to dot, raw Graphviz instructions are saved in dot format. This does not require Graphviz
# to be installed. Default value: pdf
filetype: jpg

# Specifies whether or not to display polymorphic hierarchies. Polymorphic associations are normally
# displayed as direct relationships. In some cases this may be confusing, because it masks their
# true nature. Enable this option if polymorphic associations play a crucial role in your domain
# model. Enabling this option will also display abstract classes. Default value: false
polymorphism: true

# Exclude specified models. Together with only, this will allow to filter out models on your
# diagram. Default value: nil. Example: exclude="User,Role"
exclude: "ApplicationRecord,ActiveRecord::InternalMetadata,ActiveRecord::SchemaMigration"
